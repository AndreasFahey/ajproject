# Project Details

- Course: BSc (Honours) in Software Development
- Module: Professional Practice in IT
- College: Galway Mayo Institute of Technology
- Students: Andreas Fahey and Joseph Griffith
- Project Supervisor: Martin Kenirons
- Module Supervisor: Damien Costello
- Project Title: AJCinemas


# Introduction

- This project was part of the module Professional Practice in IT in the Course Software Development in GMIT.

- The purpose of doing this project as part of the module was to give the us, the students a chance to design and develop a project and deliver a piece of software inside the time provided and in a high standard manner.

- In this project we were asked to develop an application or program that connects to a database of our choosing and stores data from it.

- We were asked to deliver a working application with an active database that co insides with the code to produce a working project.



# Project Overview

- We decided to build a web application that will have a user login and register. Once a login is made the user will then be able book tickets to go see a movie from the past or present. (Limited options as there are so many movies).

- The project was decided upon when we agreed to use Ionic 4/Angular 7 and Firebase to produce an application. We narrowed it down to an online cinema booking web application.

- Once agreed on the project to pursue, we then started to plan out pages and functionality of the project. We decided to go with a login and register and a CRUD system for booking a ticket with a firestore firebase database.
When all agreed upon, we set up our GitHub repository.

- The architecture of this app uses Ionic/angular as the front end (styling the pages, HTML, etc... while it uses firebase as the backend for the database as well as the server.

# Features and Deployment
